The following document outlines the process of counting the number of matches between the GTDB-Biosample data and the number of Biosamples represented in the dataset with matching entries.

1) sort BiosampleGTDB.txt > sorted_BiosampleGTDB.txt
This command will sort our GTDB biosample list which was previously made, writing it to a new file for easier subsequent comparison

2) cut -f1 Dataset.tsv | sort | uniq > sorted_dataset_entries.txt
This command cuts the first column from our GTDB taxonomy file, sort it correctly, remove duplicates and write it to a new file.

3) comm -12 sorted_BiosampleGTDB.txt sorted_dataset_entries.txt | wc -l
This final command compares the two files, counting the number of matches produced.

The final figures were 33,221 in total for the number of biosamples in our dataset.
33,220 matches were found between this text file and the GTDB file (the missing one is the header). 
As a result on subsequent merging of the GTDB taxonomy into our dataset all biosample(Genomes) will have a GTDB taxonomic component present.
