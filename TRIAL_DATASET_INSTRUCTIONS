In order to produce a smaller trial dataset for initial testing the following process was used.

1) cut -f 1 Final_dataset.tsv > Sample.txt
This removed the first column from the dataset and wrote it to a seperate file.

2) uniq Sample.txt > Sample1.txt
This removed all duplicates from the column file.

3) total_lines=$(wc -l < Sample1.txt)
This counts the total number of lines in our Biosample text file.

4) num_lines_to_select=$(awk "BEGIN {print int($total_lines * 0.05)}")
This calculates 5% of the total number of lines in our Dataset.

5) shuf Sample1.txt | -n head $num_lines_to_select > output.txt
Here at random 5% of the lines are selected and written to a text file for use in later parsing,

6) awk 'NR==FNR {Sample1[$1]; next} $1 in Sample1' Sample1.txt Final_dataset.tsv > Final_test_dataset.tsv
This final command parses the random list of 5% of the Genomes from the Master dataset and writes them to a subsequent new tsv file for later parsing.
